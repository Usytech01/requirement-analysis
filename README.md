## ⚙️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The **Requirement Analysis** phase involves several structured activities that help define, refine, and confirm the software requirements.
These activities ensure that the development team clearly understands what to build and that the stakeholders’ expectations are accurately represented.

Below are the **five key activities** involved in Requirement Analysis:

---

### 🔹 **1. Requirement Gathering**

* This is the initial step where **information is collected** from all relevant stakeholders (clients, users, business owners, etc.).
* It involves techniques like **interviews, surveys, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions,** and **document reviews**.
* The goal is to **identify what users need** and understand the **problems the system aims to solve**.

---

### 🔹 **2. Requirement Elicitation**

* This step goes beyond simple data collection by **engaging stakeholders actively** to uncover their true needs, preferences, and constraints.
* Elicitation techniques include **workshops, use cases, observation, prototyping,** and **focus groups**.
* The focus is on **discovering hidden requirements** that may not be immediately obvious or documented.

---

### 🔹 **3. Requirement Documentation**

* Once requirements are gathered and elicited, they are **clearly recorded and organized** in documents such as the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**.
* This documentation ensures **transparency** and **serves as a reference** for designers, developers, and testers.
* It includes both **functional** (what the system does) and **non-functional** (how the system performs) requirements.

---

### 🔹 **4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling**

* At this stage, the requirements are **analyzed for clarity, feasibility, and consistency**.
* Modeling tools like **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), Use Case Diagrams, UML models,** or **Process Flowcharts** may be used to visualize the system’s behavior.
* The goal is to **identify conflicts or ambiguities** and ensure the requirements are **logically structured** and **technically achievable**.

---

### 🔹 **5. Requirement Validation**

* This final step ensures that the documented requirements **accurately represent stakeholder needs** and are **realistic to implement**.
* Validation techniques include **reviews, walkthroughs, prototyping,** and **stakeholder sign-offs**.
* It helps detect errors, inconsistencies, or omissions **before development begins**, reducing rework and project risks.

---

### 🧠 **In Summary**

The success of any software project largely depends on how effectively these activities are performed.
By systematically gathering, analyzing, documenting, modeling, and validating requirements, teams can ensure that the final software solution meets user expectations and business objectives.

Perfect ✅ Here’s the **ready-to-paste Markdown section** for your `README.md` — clean, professional, and aligned with your instructions.
It introduces a new section titled **“Types of Requirements”** with two subsections for **Functional** and **Non-functional Requirements**, each defined and illustrated with examples relevant to a **Booking Management Project**.

---

## 🧾 Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are generally categorized into two main types:
**Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements.**

Both types are essential for building a system that is **useful, reliable, and user-friendly.**
While **functional requirements** describe *what* the system should do, **non-functional requirements** define *how well* the system should perform those functions.

---

### ⚙️ **Functional Requirements**

**Definition:**
Functional Requirements specify the **specific behaviors, actions, or functions** a system must perform.
They describe **what the system should do** to achieve its objectives and fulfill user needs.

**Examples for a Booking Management Project:**

* 🏨 The system should allow users to **search for available rooms** based on date, location, and room type.
* 🧾 The system should enable users to **book, modify, or cancel reservations**.
* 💳 The system should process **online payments** securely using credit/debit cards or other payment gateways.
* 📅 The system should send **booking confirmation and reminder notifications** via email or SMS.
* 👤 The system should allow **administrators to manage room availability, pricing, and user accounts**.

These requirements define the **core functionality** and user interactions that make the system operational.

---

### ⚡ **Non-functional Requirements**

**Definition:**
Non-functional Requirements describe the **quality attributes** or **performance standards** that the system must meet.
They define *how* the system performs rather than *what* it does.

**Examples for a Booking Management Project:**

* ⚡ The system should **load any page within 3 seconds** under normal network conditions.
* 🔒 All user data and payment details must be **encrypted** to ensure **security and privacy**.
* 🕒 The system should maintain **99.9% uptime** to ensure availability for users at all times.
* 📱 The system interface should be **responsive and accessible** across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
* 🌍 The system should support **multiple languages and currencies** for international users.
* 🧩 The system should handle **at least 1,000 concurrent bookings** without performance degradation.

These requirements ensure that the system is **efficient, secure, scalable, and user-friendly.**

---

### 🧠 **In Summary**

| **Type**                        | **Focus**                                     | **Examples (Booking Management Project)**                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Requirements**     | Define **what** the system should do          | Booking rooms, managing users, sending notifications, processing payments |
| **Non-functional Requirements** | Define **how well** the system should perform | Performance speed, security, reliability, scalability, usability          |
